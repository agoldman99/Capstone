      <p><h2> "The key to leveraging play into all aspects of the school day
        and life is understanding that, above all else, play is intensely personal...</h2></p>
        <p>The challenge in defining play is that almost anything can be play if it
        fulfills certain characteristics, and it is these characteristics that make play
        so essential for brain development...</p></div>
      <br><br>
      <div class="answer1div">
        <p>In short, something is play if you have chosen to do it, have the capacity
        to pretend and change as you go, and enjoy it for the most part. This does
        not mean, however, that play is always "nice" or "safe"...</p>
      <br><br></div>
      <div class="answer1div">
        <p>True play always involves a certain amount of safe risk, and through
        navigating that risk, children and adults learn ways to survive in the real
        world, both emotionally and physically."</p></div>

      <div class="answer1div">
      <p><h2> "There is an argument in the world that suggests that play can 
        happen only when work is done...</h2></p>
        <p>Yet children show us time and time again that play 
        is the way they work...
      <br><br>
        Play is its own method of instruction. Because play 
        is safe and familiar, children feel free to take 
        risks and try on new learning...
      <br><br>
        When children engage in imaginative play, 
        not only do they develop their creativity, 
        they learn to be flexible thinkers, and 
        they develop core social skills, such as 
        negotiation, collaboration, and empathy."</p>

      <div class="answer1div">
      <p><h2> "In organized pre-primary settings, play experiences
        are enhanced when children are provided with ample time
        and space to engage freely with the pre-primary setting/environment.
        Play can occur in many forms: play with objects; imaginary play;
        play with peers and adults; solitary play; cooperative play; 
        associative play; physical play...</h2></p>
        <p>Play is considered children's "work" and is the vehicle through
        which children acquire knowledge and skills, allowing
        children to engage independently and with others...
      <br><br>
        The role of teachers and other adults in the room/environment 
        is to enable and scaffold playful experiences and learning - 
        this requires thoughtful planning (for example, setting out
        materials to pique children's curiosity) and spontaneous interactions
        building on natural curiosity and ideas (for example, following
        the children's lead in pretend play). Providing children with active 
        and playful hands-on experiences to help foster and enrich learning"</p>
