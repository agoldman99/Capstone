            The challenge in defining play is that almost anything can be play if it
            fulfills certain characteristics, and it is these characteristics that make play
            so essential for brain development...

            In short, something is play if you have chosen to do it, have the capacity
            to pretend and change as you go, and enjoy it for the most part. This does
            not mean, however, that play is always "nice" or "safe"...

            True play always involves a certain amount of safe risk, and through
            navigating that risk, children and adults learn ways to survive in the real
            world, both emotionally and physically."

            Play is its own method of instruction. Because play 
            is safe and familiar, children feel free to take

            When children engage in imaginative play, 
            not only do they develop their creativity, 
            they learn to be flexible thinkers, and 
            they develop core social skills, such as 
            negotiation, collaboration, and empathy."

            The role of teachers and other adults in the room/environment 
            is to enable and scaffold playful experiences and learning - 
            this requires thoughtful planning (for example, setting out
