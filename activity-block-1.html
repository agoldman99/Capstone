          <p><h2> "The key to leveraging play into all aspects of the school day
            and life is understanding that, above all else, play is intensely personal...</h2></p>
            <p>The challenge in defining play is that almost anything can be play if it
            fulfills certain characteristics, and it is these characteristics that make play
            so essential for brain development...</p>
          <br><br>
            <p>In short, something is play if you have chosen to do it, have the capacity
            to pretend and change as you go, and enjoy it for the most part. This does
            not mean, however, that play is always "nice" or "safe"...</p>
          <br><br>
            <p>True play always involves a certain amount of safe risk, and through
            navigating that risk, children and adults learn ways to survive in the real
            world, both emotionally and physically."</p>

          <div class="answer1div">
          <p><h2> "There is an argument in the world that suggests that play can 
            happen only when work is done...</h2></p>
            <p>Yet children show us time and time again that play 
            is the way they work...
          <br><br>
            Play is its own method of instruction. Because play 
            is safe and familiar, children feel free to take 
            risks and try on new learning...
          <br><br>
            When children engage in imaginative play, 
            not only do they develop their creativity, 
            they learn to be flexible thinkers, and 
            they develop core social skills, such as 
            negotiation, collaboration, and empathy."</p>
