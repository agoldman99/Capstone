      <p> "The key to leveraging play into all aspects of the school day
        and life is understanding that, above all else, play is intensely personal...</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>The challenge in defining play is that almost anything can be play if it
        fulfills certain characteristics, and it is these characteristics that make play
        so essential for brain development...</p>
      <br><br>
        <p>In short, something is play if you have chosen to do it, have the capacity
        to pretend and change as you go, and enjoy it for the most part. This does
        not mean, however, that play is always "nice" or "safe"...</p>
      <br><br>
        <p>True play always involves a certain amount of safe risk, and through
        navigating that risk, children and adults learn ways to survive in the real
        world, both emotionally and physically." -- Purposeful Play Book</p>

      <h1 class="what-is-play-head">TYPES OF PLAY</h1>
      <div class="answer1div">
        <div class="types-flex-container">
          <div class="types-flex-item">
          <h5>1. Fantasy/Imaginative Play</h5>
          <br>
          In fantasy play, children choose an imaginary scenario in which they take on
          and act out roles and then determine a set of rules from these roles. Self-regulation 
          becomes essential as children develop and adhere to sets of rules that define 
          those rules.
          <br>
          Because fantasy play often requires the substitution of one object for another,
          it also develops abstract thinking.
          <br>
          As children begin to think abstractly, they conceptualize or generalize their
          understanding that a single object can have multiple meanings. This kind of abstract 
          thinking is an essential tool for higher-level thinking and is often mandated in 
          state standards, including the Common Core.
          </div>
          <div class="types-flex-item">
            <h5>2. Constructive Play</h5>
            <br>
            Constructive play is an organized form of play that is, in many ways, goal- 
            and product- oriented. Children use materials to create something, an activity 
            that increases in complexity as they get older. Most constructive play happens 
            in classrooms during choice time and typically involves playing or constructing 
            with three-dimensional materials like blocks, playdough, art materials, and 
            recycled materials.
            <br>
            Because of its enormous potential for problem solving, connecting, deepening understanding, 
            and replicating learning with open-ended materials, constructive play is one way 
            to keep math, science, and engineering relevant in our classrooms.
            <br>
            As children examine, explore, sort, and arrange materials, ideas and imagination begin 
            to flow, and questions arise naturally. Kids wonder: What will happen if I put this here?
            How tall will it go? How can I keep my structure from breaking? What colors do I need to use?
            </div>
            <div class="types-flex-item">
              <h5>3. Games with Rules</h5>
              <br>
              In another kind of game - games with rules - kids develop a different set of 
              skills and strategies than in fantasy play, where children set the boundaries
              of play. In a game, rules are set, and in order to play the game and make the game 
              work, you have to comply with those rules. 
              <br>
              As children come to understand that they have to follow the rules or there is no game, 
              they strengthen self-regulation. 
              <br>
              Games with rules are often characterized by logic and order, and as children grow 
              older they begin to develop strategy and planning in their game playing. 
              <br>
              When playing games with rules, children also build important social skills such as 
              cooperation and healthy competition. They need to negotiate and work cohesively to 
              play the game. Competition is a mighty force in human nature that playing rule-based 
              games can work to regulate. Understanding what it means to win and how it feels to lose 
              is an essential part of building empathy. Games with rules can also build resilience when 
              kids experience setbacks.

            <div class="types-flex-item">
              <h5>4. Parallel Play</h5>
              <br>
              In this type of play, the child chooses to play with the same 
              materials as another child, such as two children playing alongside 
              one another in the block center. One child might be building a 
              spaceship, and the other might be building a zoo. They tend not to 
              communicate, but if they do it is to talk about what they themselves
              are doing.

              <div class="types-flex-item-horz">
                <h5>1. Unoccupied Behavior</h5>
                <br>
                In this most immature form of play, a child randomly observes
                anything that catches his interest. If nothing catches his interest,
                he will occupy himself by fidgeting or engaging in repetitive behavior,
                such as spinning in circles or banging hands on a table.
                </div>
                <div class="types-flex-item-horz">
                  <h5>2. Onlooker Behavior</h5>
                  <br>
                  The child's observations are more deliberate in nature, in that 
                  the child chooses to observe children at play. She might even approach
                  children playing and ask them questions about their play but does not
                  attempt to play herself.
                  </div>
                  <div class="types-flex-item-horz">
                    <h5>3. Solitary Play</h5>
                    <br>
                    As the name suggests, in solitary play a child chooses to play alone. 
                    The child might play near another group of children; however, he plays
                    with a different toy or activity and is self-absorbed in his own play.

                    <br>
                    In this type of play, the child chooses to play with the same 
                    materials as another child, such as two children playing alongside 
                    one another in the block center. One child might be building a

                    communicate, but if they do it is to talk about what they themselves
                    are doing.

                  <div class="types-flex-item-horz">
                      <h5>5. Associative Play</h5>
                      <br>
                      In associative play children choose to play together in a group with
                      the same materials or activity. They share materials with one another 
                      and may even decide to work on an identical project; however there is 
                      no planning involved or organization of roles. 
                    </div>
                  <div class="types-flex-item-horz">
                      <h5>6. Cooperative Play</h5>
                      <br>
                      This is considered the most mature form of play. In cooperative play, 
                      children plan how their play will go. They discuss and negotiate roles, 
                      and they role-play and dramatize scenarios. In this form of play, 
                      children often need to compromise and forego their individual goals in 
                      order to sustain the play in the group activity.

      <div class="answer1div">
      <p> "The home environment and the community are where young children
        spend the larger, if not the largest, part of their early lives, interacting
        with parents, siblings, extended family members, and neighbors.
        These interactions and relationships have a significant influence over how
        children understand and experience the world around them. Indeed, 
        home environments and the community provide excellent opportunities to 
        promote learning through play from the early years through pre-primary 
        and primary years.
        <br><br>
        Primary caregivers, as children's "first teachers," are the biggest 
        supporters of children's learning, and therefore have an important role 
        in creating the space for learning through play. It is therefore essential 
        to support caregivers and empower them to take an active role in 
        shaping children's learning and development, as well as to facilitate playful 
        learning for their children at home and in the community 
        in day-to-day experiences." - UNICEF/LEGO
